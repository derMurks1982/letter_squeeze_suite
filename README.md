Get it? 🤓

A collection of practical, no-nonsense WordPress plugins, designed to make your multisite admin life easier
  with a little flair.

## Contents
### 🧙‍♂️ WIP
- `Bulk Menu Editor`: Edit WP menus and menu items across blogs/sites
  - do text replacements / formatting
  - edit columns (like menu /menu item titles, URL target, ordering etc)
  
### 📦 Packed and pending
- `Multisite User Sync`: Keep users synced across all your sub-sites
  - makes use of a **non-interactive** ("must-use" / MU-Plugin) part
  - which is usable separately, see README there)

### 📓 NYI, future  idea
- `Custom Link Templates`: Batch-format post content like a HTML/CSS wizard. (NYI, placeholder)
and more to come...


## 🛠 Installation
### via file system browser / FTP / SSH:
- Just copy any named plugin folder into your WordPress `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and activate from the dashboard.
### WP-CLI [ZIP file of Meta-Repo not useful; this is more of a note-to-self entry]:
- wp plugin install https://github.com/derMurks1982/letter_squeeze_suite/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
